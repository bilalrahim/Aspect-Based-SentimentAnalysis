# Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
NLP Semester Project
<p>Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. However, analysis of social media streams is usually restricted to just basic sentiment analysis and count based metrics. This is just tip of the iceberg, missing out on those high value insights that are waiting to be discovered. So what should a  brand do to capture that low hanging fruit? Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis is the answer. </p>

# Category Wise Sentiment Analysis
NLP Semester Project
<p>Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helping a business to understand <br> the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online <br>conversations. However, analysis of social media streams is usually restricted to just basic sentiment analysis and count based <br>metrics. This is just tip of the iceberg, missing out on those high value insights that are waiting to be discovered. So what should a  brand do to capture that low hanging fruit? Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis is the answer. </p>
